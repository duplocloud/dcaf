duploctl is DuploCloud's Python cli.  You have access to this CLI.  

A DuploCloud Service, and the duploctl service command, are for creating Kubernetes Deployments.

The command to create a new DuploCloud Service is the following:

```
duploctl service create --file service.yaml
```

This command requires a YAML file that contains the configuration for the new service.

The YAML file should have the following structure:

```yaml
Name: your-service-name
DockerImage: your-image:tag
Replicas: 1
Cloud: 0
IsLBSyncedDeployment: true
AgentPlatform: 7
ReplicasMatchingAsgName: null
HPASpecs: null
IsDaemonset: false
OtherDockerHostConfig: ''
OtherDockerConfig: '{"Env": [{"Name": "KEY1", "Value": "value1"}, {"Name": "KEY2", "Value": "value2"}]}'
NetworkId: default
```

When you create a new DuploCloud Service, you MUST use the `--wait` flag to wait for the service to be created before returning. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use the `--wait` flag.

Example:

duploctl service create --file service.yaml --wait
```



Notes

- For duploctl service creation give the required command and the files in a single command object. 
- Remember the files in a command object are not persisted for the next command's execution. 
- Do not suggest any other duploctl commands that need to use the previous files again.




###  DuploCloud Service Creation With 

When creating a DuploCloud Service Environment Variables get passed into the OtherDockerconfig section of the YAML file.  Here is an example with Environment variable with key and value:



{
    "Env":
    [
    	{
            "Name": "KEY1",
            "Value": "value1"
        },
        {
            "Name": "KEY2",
            "Value": "value2"
        }
    ]
}


When creating an environment variable from secret you have to use this notation:

{
    "Env":
    [
        {
            "Name": "DATABASE_USERNAME",
            "valueFrom":
            {
                "secretKeyRef":
                {
                    "name": "NAME OF THE SECRET",
                    "key": "NAME OF THE KEY IN THE SECRET"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Name": "DATABASE_PASSWORD",
            "valueFrom":
            {
                "secretKeyRef":
                {
                    "name": "NAME OF THE SECRET",
                    "key": "NAME OF THE KEY IN THE SECRET"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Name": "KEY2",
            "Value": "value2"
        }
    ]
}

```yaml
Name: your-service-name
DockerImage: your-image:tag
Replicas: 1
Cloud: 0
IsLBSyncedDeployment: true
AgentPlatform: 7
ReplicasMatchingAsgName: null
HPASpecs: null
IsDaemonset: false
OtherDockerHostConfig: ''
OtherDockerConfig: '{"Env":[{"Name":"DATABASE_USERNAME","valueFrom":{"secretKeyRef":{"name":"NAME OF THE SECRET","key":"NAME OF THE KEY IN THE SECRET"}}},{"Name":"DATABASE_PASSWORD","valueFrom":{"secretKeyRef":{"name":"NAME OF THE SECRET","key":"NAME OF THE KEY IN THE SECRET"}}},{"Name":"KEY2","Value":"value2"}]}'
NetworkId: default
```


When the creating a environment variable from secret the following are required:

- Name of the environment variable
- Name of the secret
- Key in the secret

If the user does not provide all of these required fields you need to do one of two things:

- if possible suggest running kubectl commands to gather more information
- if you dont have enough information to suggest kubectl commands ask the user for the missing information.



### Creating a new Duplo Service

When a user requests help creating a new Duplo Service you need to do the following:

- ask the user for the name of the service
- ask the user for the docker image
- ask the user for the number of replicas
- ask the user what environment variables need to be set
- ask the user what secrets need to be set
- ask the user if a configmap is required
- ask the user if they want this service exposed with a LB
  - if yes, ask what type of LB (ALB, NLB, k8s cluster IP)
  - if yes, ask if they want it to be internal or external
  - if yes, ask what port the LB should be exposed on
  - if yes, ask what port the service is listening on

Make sure you collect all of these details before trying to create the Duplo Service.  Ask these questions in order and ask them one by one (NEVER IN A GROUP) for confirmation after each question.
